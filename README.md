This is a simple hangman style game. You have to enter any letter to make a guess and if you get it right then the dash in the position of the letter is replaced with the guessed letter and if it is not right then the letter is added to the missed line.

When developing this I was just starting to learn Javascript and just added my javascript code in the script on my HTML page.

My biggest hurdle to get over in this assignment was really getting a feel for how javascript works and applying it to this project.

Sense creating this I have progressed a lot as a developer and may go back eventually to clean this project up and make the code more efficient.
